Interesting observation being that the model returns a higher score when 'Not_Canceled' is considered the positive label. Interested in seeing other scoring methods, f1 scoring potentially might not fit the situation. Another interesting observation, adding categorical data more significantly increased the f1 score when positive label was 'Canceled'.\n","<br>V5: Ensembling done by using a voting classifier. Considering the performance of the past version, our ensembled models have provided a better performance. However, the increase of performance is very marginal at this point. If anyone wonders why I am using logisitc regression, I wanted to analyze the performance of a linear model on this data. Maybe in future notebooks or Versions I will use a non linear model on this same data. \n","<br>V6: Switched model to XGBoosting, and saw significant improvement. It is almost laughable how much better the performance of XGBoosting. Moreover, I added some preprocessing things, but I don't think there are any changes that came out of it. I believe a less \"easy\" to work with dataset would have had improvements\n","<br>V7: oops fixed a small error\n","<br>V8: hyperparameter tuning allowed for slight improvement in
